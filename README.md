# JavaScript Backend Assignment

FHSU INF653 Web Backend Final Project: 

## Assignment Notes
- MongoDB uses _id for the ID key, this code reflects using _id vs id in the API.
- the .env file contains PORT=xxxx and MONGOURI="mongodb+srv://un:pw@cluster0.mongodb.net/studentDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0"
- no default route or web pages were included in this assignment per the assignment requirements.

## Development Environment

### Docker
Development for new projects requires many dependencies, and if you complete may projects, the dependencies will overlap or use the wrong versions, so by developing in a docker container, all the dependencies for each project are kept separate. For this project, I am using the node:latest container image, with the docker compose file below. I use Portainer to manage all my containers running across a few different computers, and use Portainer's attach console to get cli access to the container.

### Networking
This project's docker container is running on my DMZ VLAN, with a docker internal bridge network between the node.js container and the MongoDB container. This design makes the MongoDB database accessible only from the Node.js container and not from any outside networks. Traffic from the internet is being reverse proxied by Traefik, also running in a docker container, in the DMZ VLAN but on a separate server. For development, the node.js container needs outbound access to the internet so it can install npm packages. This is normally not allowed in the DMZ VLAN, and a NFTables firewall rule: 

```
define DMZ_inf653final = 10.0.20.12 #inf653final.int2117.jahartley.com.
chain forward { //skip to relevent rules...
    # DMZ exceptions
    ip saddr $DMZ_inf653final oifname $vlInternet accept
```
has been added to the forward chain, only during development.

### DNS
For this project to be reachable on the internet, a CNAME record was added to my external DNS provider. Internal DNS is provided by bind in another container.

### Reverse Proxy
This project is using Traefik for its reverse proxy, and for HTTPS, using a Traefik dynamic file provider, example below:

```yml
http:
  routers:
    inf653final:
      entryPoints:
        - websecureint
        - websecure
      rule: Host(`inf653final.jahartley.com`)
      service: inf653final
      tls:
        certResolver: leresolver
  services:
    inf653final:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://10.0.20.12:3000"
```

#### docker compose
Compose file explanation:
- working_dir: sets the working directory for node, use as bind point for bind folder
- volume bind: bind the directory your code is in into the working_dir
- stdin_open & tty: keeps the container running even if you disconnect the console
- command: the command the container runs after starting.

````yaml
services:
  nodejs:
    image: node:latest
    working_dir: /app
    networks:
      dipv20:
        ipv4_address: 10.0.20.12
      inf653final:
    volumes:
      - /store/Docs/School/Judson/FHSU/2025-1-Spring/INF653/INF653Final:/app
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    command: bash
    user: node
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/home/node/.npm-global
      - PATH=$PATH:/home/node/.npm-global/bin # optionally if you want to run npm global bin without specifying path
      - PATH=$PATH:./node_modules/.bin

networks:
  dipv20:
    external: true
  inf653final:

````

### NodeJS Debugger
Remember to use the built-in NodeJs debugger with one of the following cli flags:
- --inspect=[host:port] Enables the inspector agent.
- --inspect-brk=[host:port] Enable the inspector agent, break at first line of code
- --inspect-wait=[host:port] Enable the inspector agent, start code execution on debugging connection.

My development environment is on my local network and in a container (which doesn't know its address), and there is no public access to the container running NodeJS, so I specify --inspect-wait=[0.0.0.0], and connect that way. IF I was developing on a container exposed to the internet, the flags above specified without the =[host:port] portion default to localhost:9229, and I use ssh to connect, and set a tunnel: 

- ssh -L 9229:localhost:9229 usr@IP

### 5. ROOT URLs:
#### a. Your root project URL should follow this pattern:

https://your-project-name.onrender.com/ 

Complete via DNS, Traefik Config.
 
This will display a simple HTML welcome page.

Complete via /routes/rootRouter.js

#### b. The REST API root URL must begin with:

https://your-project-name.onrender.com/api/

All API routes should be organized under /api.

Complete via /index.js

#### c. A catch-all must be implemented for non-existent routes:

If Accept: text/html, return a 404 HTML page.
If Accept: application/json, return a JSON object: { "error": "404 Not Found" }.

Complete via /index.js

### 6. Your REST API must support the following GET requests:

| Request                  |  Response Description                               | REQ | Complete |

| GET/api/bookings/:id     |  Return a specific booking's detail (only for user) | 6.f | Y        |

Notes:

1. Query parameters are optional and can be used together.
2. These endpoints must return event data from MongoDB.
3. Filtering logic must be implemented server-side.

### 7. Your REST API must support the following POST requests:
